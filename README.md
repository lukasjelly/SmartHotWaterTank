# Welcome to my SmartHotWaterTank Project

## Project Summary
This project aims to create a "Smart Hot Water Tank" system using a Raspberry Pi, sensors, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The system would allow homeowners to view and control the current temperature of their hot water cylinder remotely through a web interface or mobile application. The project involves using temperature sensors to collect data on the hot water cylinder's temperature and sending this data to the Raspberry Pi for processing. The Raspberry Pi would then send the data to AWS for storage and analysis. The homeowner would be able to access this data and make adjustments to the temperature through the web interface or mobile application. This project would provide a convenient and energy-efficient solution for homeowners to manage their hot water usage and reduce energy costs.
